Welocme to my game! For my first General Assembly proect I recreated a classic slot machine game

The game opens up with a view of the slot machine, which contains 3 columns (dials) of symbols that randomly generate when the "spin" button is clicked. There is also an input box where you can type in the amount that you want to bet and just below that is a text box that indicates the total amount that you have earned (or lossed) while playing the game.
the objective of the game is to get all 3 symbols that generate to be the same. 
Even though the results of my game are determined by chance, I generated win and loss conditions. 
When all 3 symbols match, a "you win!" text pops up on the screen and alarm sound is triggered.

If all your total amount earned hits 0 or below, the next time you try to click the spin button, a "game over" screen will launch.

On this screen, there is a "play again" button which will take you back to the game.

Enjoy!

Future steps: In the future, I hope to improve the styling of my project so it will look better on bigger screens. At the moment, I haven't quite figured out how to make my game fill the screen without it looking clunky.
