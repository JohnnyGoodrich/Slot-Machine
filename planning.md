For project 1, I will be recreating a slot machine game. 

Pseudo code:
start game screen with start button
    -when button is pressed - hide start screen - show game screen - generate random starting values for slot screen
upon entering game screen all buttons and images appear
function that will make starting numbers/images random

total balance 
spin wheel function/button
    -function when activated generates random numbers for each number position
win a round funciton:
    -when all numbers are the same in a row, return "you've won" message and increase balance
